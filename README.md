This project contains the web client (<https://loved.sh>), web server (<https://loved.sh/api>), and related tools for osu!'s [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Project_Loved). See [cl8n/project-loved](https://github.com/cl8n/project-loved) for more management tools.

## Development with Docker

The provided `docker-compose` configuration sets up a development environment with the client, API, MySQL, and Nginx. The client is served from http://localhost:8080 by default. Server environment variables under "API server options" and "MySQL connection options" are overridden in this environment.

### Bridge package

The `bridge` directory contains a package required by both the client and server, but it's not built automatically by either. You will need to rebuild it yourself if changes are made:

```
cd bridge
npm install
npm run build
```

The package will also need to be reinstalled in `client` and `server` if any of its dependencies change, with `npm install ../bridge`.

### Database migrations

`/server/migrations` contains SQL to create the `project_loved` database schema. There are no backward migrations.

On the first run of the database container, the `project_loved` user will be created with an empty password. MySQL is exposed to the host machine on port 3306. The `project_loved` database will be created and existing migrations will be applied, but future ones need to be run manually.

### Live data

Regular database exports (sans `extra_tokens` and `sessions`) are posted to <https://loved.sh/exports>. **This will drop and re-create all other tables!**

```
docker-compose exec database /import-live-data.sh [export URL]
```

### Creating an admin user

```
docker-compose run --rm api ./build/init-user.js <osu! username>
```

## Deployment

### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 16
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 8

### Client

- ```
  cd bridge
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- ```
  cd client
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

The built webpage will be in `/client/build`; it's an SPA.

### Server

- ```
  cd bridge
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- ```
  cd server
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the options, or export the environment variables separately
- Run server
  - Directly: `NODE_ENV=production ./build/index.js`
  - With systemd: See provided `project-loved-web.example.service`

Request paths under `/api` should proxy to the server, paths exactly matching files should serve the files, and everything else should serve the client's `index.html`.

Also note that the `loved-bridge` package is installed as a link to `../bridge`, so it will need to be deployed either at that path or at the target of a symbolic link from that path.
